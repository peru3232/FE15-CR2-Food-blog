# FE15-CR2-Food-blog
Design of a simply food blog side

This project consists of a landing page and additional pages too. Plain HTML and SCSS were used.

To view the pages simply clone this repo then open index.html in your browser.

This project was done as a solution to a end of the week project during my fullstack course at code factory.

Please view the assignment.pdf to view the expected results.

Cheers!
